# E-Commerce Project using Linear Regression

This project aims to implement linear regression using scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to predict the annual spending of customers at an e-commerce store that provides in-store styling and clothing consultation sessions. The dataset comprises details of customers who participated in these sessions and went on to make purchases via either the mobile app or the website.
